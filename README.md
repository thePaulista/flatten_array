# flatten_array
goal: flatten an array nonrecursively, without using the .flatten method. 

This was an exercise given to the module 1 Echo group (I'm in the supernewbie Foxtrot group). My fun pairing partner
was Chad Ellison. 

I called the file joshcheekflattenarray.rb because he gave us the inner workings of his thoughts on that first week
- that ask a flourish of questions and go from there.  The questions he asked to get the code started were:
are you an array, if so, are you empty, if so, then do this, else, do that.  So, we started with those question as our base
to solve this.  

We went kosher, and even added a test for fun!

winter holiday fun!
